# Express.js Backend Development Journey

> "The correct way of learning is the most hated way - studying 20% theory/videos and the rest is application and throwing yourself into the fire."

This repository documents my learning journey through Express.js backend development following a 20/80 principle:
- **20%** focused learning from videos and resources
- **80%** hands-on building and problem-solving

## Learning Approach

Each week follows a Learn ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Expand ‚Üí Solve pattern designed to create lasting knowledge through practical application.

## Phase 1: Express.js Backend Development (4 weeks)

- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Following Along**: Expanding Express knowledge through tutorial implementation
  - **Key Concepts**: 
    - CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods
    - Custom middleware development
    - Request validation and error handling

### Week 3: Data Handling & Database
- **Theory (20%)**: Templating, static files, form data, and database connections
- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Following Along**: Implementing database connections and data handling
  - **Key Concepts**: 
    - MongoDB integration with error handling

## Projects Showcase

Projects built using the knowledge from this learning journey are maintained in separate repositories:

- [URL Shortener](https://github.com/kareemycode/express-url-shortener) - A URL shortening service with custom slugs
- [Task Manager API](https://github.com/kareemycode/task-manager-api) - REST API for managing tasks
- [Blog Platform](https://github.com/kareemycode/blog-platform) - Complete blog backend with MongoDB
- [E-commerce API](https://github.com/kareemycode/ecommerce-api) - Full-featured e-commerce backend

## Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository regularly with:
- üìù Notes from the learning material
- üíª Code examples from following the course
- üîÑ Refactoring and improvements based on what I learn

## Resources

- Main tutorial used: [Express.js Full Course]
- Additional references and documentation links will be added to each section

## Goals

By the end of Phase 1, I aim to:
1. Build production-ready Express.js applications
2. Implement secure authentication systems
3. Create well-structured RESTful APIs
4. Work confidently with MongoDB in a Node.js environment
5. Develop custom middleware for various purposes
