# Express.js Backend Development Journey

> "The correct way of learning is the most hated way - studying 20% theory/videos and the rest is application and throwing yourself into the fire."

This repository documents my learning journey through Express.js backend development following a 20/80 principle:
- **20%** focused learning from videos and resources
- **80%** hands-on building and problem-solving

## Learning Approach

Each week follows a Learn → Build → Expand → Solve pattern designed to create lasting knowledge through practical application.

## Phase 1: Express.js Backend Development (4 weeks)

### Week 1: Express Fundamentals
- **Theory (20%)**: Express introduction, setup, and routing fundamentals
- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Project**: Basic Express Server
    - Creating properly structured Express applications
    - Implementing organized route files
    - Building dynamic routing with parameters
  - **Problem-Solving Tasks**:
    - URL shortener with custom slugs
    - Route parameters validation
    - Nested resource routes

### Week 2: HTTP Methods & Middleware
- **Theory (20%)**: HTTP methods and middleware implementation
- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Project**: Task Manager API
    - CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods
    - Custom authentication middleware
    - Request validation middleware
    - Logging middleware
  - **Problem-Solving Tasks**:
    - Rate limiting middleware
    - Error handling middleware
    - Request body sanitization

### Week 3: Data Handling & Database
- **Theory (20%)**: Templating, static files, form data, and database connections
- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Project**: Blog Platform Backend
    - MongoDB integration with error handling
    - Schemas for posts, users, and comments
    - File upload functionality for blog images
    - MongoDB query-based search functionality
  - **Problem-Solving Tasks**:
    - Pagination implementation for blog posts
    - Category and tag filtering
    - Database aggregation for statistics

### Week 4: Authentication & API Development
- **Theory (20%)**: Cookies, sessions, authentication, and RESTful API design
- **Practice (80%)**:
  - **Project**: E-commerce API
    - JWT authentication implementation
    - User roles and permissions
    - Complete product and order APIs
    - Cart functionality with sessions
  - **Problem-Solving Tasks**:
    - OAuth authentication
    - Refresh token mechanism
    - Payment processing webhooks

## Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository regularly with:
- 📝 Notes from the learning material
- 💻 Code for each project
- 🧩 Solutions to the problem-solving tasks
- 🔄 Refactoring and improvements based on what I learn

## Resources

- Main tutorial used: [Express.js Full Course]
- Additional references and documentation links will be added to each section

## Goals

By the end of Phase 1, I aim to:
1. Build production-ready Express.js applications
2. Implement secure authentication systems
3. Create well-structured RESTful APIs
4. Work confidently with MongoDB in a Node.js environment
5. Develop custom middleware for various purposes
